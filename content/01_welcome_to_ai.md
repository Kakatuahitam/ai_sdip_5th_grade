# [01] Welcome to Artificial Intelligence
<!--  -->
Hi, we recite Basmallah together before start our session

> **Bismillahirrahmanirrahim**

## Getting to know to Artificial Intelligence
### [Introduction]

Let's watch this video first:

:::{iframe} https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQPC4_DsJ8I?si=Qal20dQ9D982swhW
Let's know what is AI here
:::

:::{hint} What we learn for this session? Click me!
:class: dropdown

We are going to know what is Artificial Intelligence by some approach. Human and AI has similarities on their Intelligence. After that we will trying to play with AI on Quick, Draw!

Then we will observe Scratch application by drawing what kind of blocks there are on an F4 Paper. You may draw it with colorful coloring tools or just black and white with beautiful shadows.
:::

So what is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence** is an intelligence in form of machine that can think and learn like human does.

Artificial Intelligence is created for doing tasks that human are not too efficient to do the task, example:
1. Creating summary of a video in less than video duration
1. Creating arts in form of images and video without regular editing process
1. Do recognize writings even it is old Egyptian writings
1. Controlling a drone without collapsing other objects
1. Finding how to manage Jakarta traffic much more better
1. and many more,

### [Connection]

:::{tip} Do you know what other things that Artificial Intelligence do better than human? Mention it and share with your friends!
:::

Let's breakdown what human intelligence and Artificial Intelligence has:
```{csv-table} Comparison on Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence
:header: "Human Intelligence", "Artificial Intelligence", "Function"
"Eye", "Computer Vision", "To see and perceive visible objects in world",
"Brain", "AI Model", "To think what and how to reach a goal",
"Body and Limbs", "Robot", "A physical body for Artificial Intelligence",
```
And many more similarities...

## Getting started to our tools called **Scratch**
<!--  -->
Scratch is something when you feels itchy and you rub it to reduce itchiness? üôÉ no, I am just kidding.

**Scratch** is an application that we can use for building an interactive stories, games, and even an animation creation to be shared with our friends and teacher using special programming language, Scratch Programming Language. We build the creation using drag and drop coding style.

Scratch is designed especially for young people even everybody can use it.

To run Scratch, you may open it on browsers or install it for Google Play Store

We are going to Scratch application now

### [Application]

In this picture, you are seeing many objects in it. Starting from a large blank panel and also an iconic Scratch Cat on the top right.

:::{tip} Task!
Teacher will give you a sheet of designated F4 paper and your task is to draw what are the object kinds you found while exploring the Scratch application.

The more object kinds you draw, the more medal you get!

:::{important} Medals of Explorer
:class: dropdown
We will do this as our extension activity for this session

| Medals Quality | Description        |
| :------------- | :----------------- |
| ‚≠ê             | 2 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê           | 5 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê         | 7 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       | 9 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     | 11 kinds of object |

### [Reflection]

So, what are the function of Scratch in learning Artificial Intelligence?

:::{hint} We learn Scratch program aiming...:
:class: dropdown

1. To create an application, we use Scratch as our very first step in programming
1. To create an app with Artificial Intelligence, we need to practice some thinking logic, so by block programming we will understand how computer (AI) thinks
1. What will we get from learning Scratch in Artitifical Intelligence subject? Feel free to share with everyone!

### [Extension]

To be more diligent, try to explore any menus, pages, or buttons in Scratch and draw it in the previous task!

In the next meeting, we will create a simple code to control the Scratch cat. Do explore Scratch application and you will be familiar as soon as you explore more!

See ya on the next session!


:::{hint} Look at me too!
