# [01] Welcome to Coding!
<!--  -->
Hi, we recite Basmallah together before start our session

> **Bismillahirrahmanirrahim**

## Getting to know to Coding
### [Introduction]

Let's watch this video first:

:::{iframe} https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1J4181W8ss?si=DxjCDpYGl67qL_-x
Let's know what is Coding here
:::

:::{hint} What we learn for this session? Click me!
:class: dropdown
We are going to know what is Coding really is by some approach. Either you are Grade 3, 4, or 5, we need to know this one first before deep diving into Coding subject along this academic year and the future üòäüöÄ

In this session we will get our hands wet by exploring Scratch app on our lovely android device. Do not tell me that you have not installed it yet, but if is not, we wait for you to install.

<!-- So what is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence** is an intelligence in form of machine that can think and learn like human does.

Artificial Intelligence is created for doing tasks that human are not too efficient to do the task, example:
1. Creating summary of a video in less than video duration
1. Creating arts in form of images and video without regular editing process
1. Do recognize writings even it is old Egyptian writings
1. Controlling a drone without collapsing other objects
1. Finding how to manage Jakarta traffic much more better
1. and many more, -->

In simple term, Coding is an activity that we do to give instructions via a specific language to the Computer. You are not misread it that Coding is also an language subject but it specifically created for telling, instruct, interacting, etc. to a Computer even many Computers at once!

Along this academic year, we learn Coding by using Block Programming approach so that's why we are using Scratch 3.0 application as it uses Block Programming paradigm.

Block Programming is a fun and friendly paradigm for children and also adult that we drag and drop blocks to create instruction for Computer. We will dive into it in the next part!

### [Connection]

:::{tip} Coding is literally writing an instruction to a computer. So, we will do identify some parts involved!
:::

Let's identify what are the parts involved in Coding!

```{csv-table} Coding parts
:header: "What", "is...", "Function"
"The Actor", "is called Coder", "Writes a code in specific computer language for computers and other humans",
"The Stuff", "is called Code", "Code is a bunch of text (computer instruction) written in specific programming language to be translated by computer and then the computer execute it into actionable instruction",
"The Executor", "is called Computer", "It is an entity of living creature made by human to simplify human tasks that is done faster, repeated, complex at a time by the computer",
```

And yes, they are some parts that involves in Coding.

:::{hint} Can you mention other parts that involved in Coding too? Tell your friends and discuss it with your Guardian or Teacher!

## Getting started to our tools called **Scratch**
<!--  -->
Scratch is something when you feels itchy and you rub it to reduce itchiness? üôÉ no, I am just kidding.

**Scratch** is an application that we can use for building an interactive stories, games, and even an animation creation to be shared with our friends and teacher using special programming language, Scratch Programming Language. We build the creation using drag and drop coding style.

Scratch is designed especially for young people even everybody can use it.

To run Scratch, you may open it on browsers or install it for Google Play Store

We are going to Scratch application now

### [Application]

In this picture, you are seeing many objects in it. Starting from a large blank panel and also an iconic Scratch Cat on the top right.

:::{tip} Task!
Teacher will give you a sheet of designated F4 paper and your task is to draw what are the object kinds you found while exploring the Scratch application.

The more object kinds you draw, the more medal you get!

:::{important} Medals of Explorer
:class: dropdown
We will do this as our extension activity for this session

| Medals Quality | Description        |
| :------------- | :----------------- |
| ‚≠ê             | 2 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê           | 5 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê         | 7 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       | 9 kinds of object  |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     | 11 kinds of object |

### [Reflection]

So, what are the function of Scratch in Coding learning?

:::{hint} We learn Scratch application aiming...:
:class: dropdown

1. To learn and master coding, we use Scratch as our very first step in Coding.
1. To create a simple program to make our task easier.
1. To build logical thinking ability so that we can solve problems in better and fluent way

<!-- So, what are the function of Scratch in learning Artificial Intelligence?

:::{hint} We learn Scratch program aiming...:
:class: dropdown

1. To create an application, we use Scratch as our very first step in programming
1. To create an app with Artificial Intelligence, we need to practice some thinking logic, so by block programming we will understand how computer (AI) thinks
1. What will we get from learning Scratch in Artitifical Intelligence subject? Feel free to share with everyone!

### [Extension]

To be more diligent, try to explore any menus, pages, or buttons in Scratch and draw it in the previous task!

In the next meeting, we will create a simple code to control the Scratch cat. Do explore Scratch application and you will be familiar as soon as you explore more!

See ya on the next session!


:::{hint} Look at me too!

Let's try some Coding can do here
(if it says Our server is Scratching its head means that it is error. Come back again to try it later!)

How to control:
{kbd}`Up`, {kbd}`Down`, {kbd}`Left`, or {kbd}`Right`
