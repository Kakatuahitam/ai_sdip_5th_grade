## Procedures that we have to follow if you want to ask user

Asking is simply interaction between two or more party that has some question from the someone who asks and answer from someone who is asked. The information should be as simple as we need, so then we also need to craft the question as clear as a crystal to prevent unwanted answer.

Answer is given based on what our format decided. It will be used as a requirement to continue project/program flow. So it will runs smooth based on what they give to us.

We will call the someone who asks is `Server` and the someone who is asked `User` to make it simple.
